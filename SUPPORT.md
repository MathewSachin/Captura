## Mail
Try to use GitHub Issues instead of mailing, it allows us to track your Feature Requests and Bug Reports better.

Use mail only in cases where personal information is involved.
Please specify what you want help with in the mail itself instead of asking for other contact information like phone number or social account details.

Avoid sending mails regarding selling Captura or making a product similar to Captura as those won't be entertained.
